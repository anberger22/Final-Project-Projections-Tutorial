# Final-Project-Projections-Tutorial

Open the Projections Lab Sheet document for a step-by-step tutorial of how to write a script that checks the spatial reference parameters of different vector GIS data layers, then transforms the data to be in the same projection.

The final_script.py file contains the complete code with comments to explain what is happening at each step.

The above script adapted to be a tool in ArcMap is the project_to_match_tool.py file.
